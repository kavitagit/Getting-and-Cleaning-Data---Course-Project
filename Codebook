The code is in file 'run_analysis.R' in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in the working directory. Process run_analisys.R script to create a tidy data set.

Steps to create run_analisys.R script :

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- set working directory - where unzipped UCI HAR Dataset was stored
- Read training and test files
- Merge training and test sets
- Assign column names to the merged data set

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Extract mean and standard deviation variables
- From the merged data set is extracted and intermediate data set with only the values of estimated mean and standard deviation 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- use the activity names to name the activities in the set
- first create the activity column for the entire dataset - test and train:
- assign a column name so we can merge on it
- join the activityLabels - we use join from the plyr package and not merge, because join preserves order
- add the column to the entire dataset

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Cleaning up the variable names
- Reassigning the new descriptive column names to the finalData set
- Labels given in raw data were changed to obtain valid R names without parentheses, dashes and commas to obtain more descriptive labels

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Create a tidy data set
- From the intermediate data set is created a final tidy data set where numeric variables are averaged for each activity and each subject.
